# About

Goal of this project was to create the first somewhat complex project. It's a clone of popular game called Flappybird written in glium (OpenGL).

# Run

To run the game you have to have the rust environment configured and simply type:

`cargo run`

or, if you want to produce optimized binary:

`cargo run --release`


# Contributions

Keeping in mind it's my first project in Rust all contributions are more than welcome! Unless it's trivial, all contributions should be followed by an issue describing the enhancement somebody is eager to do :)
